# Safety Implementation Guidelines

## What Triggers Crisis Protocol
- User mentions suicide, self-harm, or ending life
- User describes current abuse or violence
- User indicates intent to hurt themselves or others

## Crisis Response (MANDATORY)
1. STOP everything
2. Show crisis resources
3. Suggest professional help
4. LOG the event
5. Don't argue or minimize

## What We NEVER Do
- Diagnose (“You have depression”)
- Prescribe (“Take this medication”)
- Minimize (“Others have it worse”)
- Dismiss (“Just think positive”)
- Claim to feel what they feel
